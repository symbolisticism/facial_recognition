# Face Clock

This Flutter application takes a picture of a user and sends it over an API to a machine learning model. The machine learning model determines if the person in the picture is a current employee, and, if it is, automatically clocks the employee in or out of work.

The application also contains an administrator login, which allows the admin to access reports showing the most recent clock events and the hours logged by each employee in the last day.
